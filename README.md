# Data Analytics about City of Chicago

The project aims at collecting various types of data about the City of Chicago and then using the data to generate various statistics to indicate the current status of Chicago based on different parameters.

The different phases of the project are data discovery, data extraction, data integration and analytics, validation and testing, reporting and visualization.

Building Permits, Business Licences, Crime, Census, Food Inspections are some of the fields about which the data was collected for the following tasks.

The analytics tasks that I worked on as part of the project are:
1. Reporting the types of crimes occurring within a certain distance of schools, stores and restaurants
2. Performing sentiment analysis of Yelp reviews for each restaurant
3. Determining the viability of a business after a failed food inspection
4. Determing the influence of businesses with liquor license on the crime rates in different neighborhoods

The major sources for data were:
- [City of Chicago's data portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org)
- [Yelp dataset](https://yelp.com/dataset)

Note: All the tasks were carried out with data related to the zip codes 60601-60607 only.
